# super-duper-braintree-api-test-thingy

`npm install` to install dependencies, then run:

`npm run dev` (added for convenience. Uses nodemon to update the server.)

or

`npm start` and `node server` in the root directory.

This project was created using [Braintree Web Drop In](https://github.com/braintree/braintree-web-drop-in) and [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This project is a quick (and somewhat half-baked) implementation of the Braintree Web Drop In for my application for the API Specialist position listed on the [Braintree careers page](https://boards.greenhouse.io/braintree/jobs/1141106?gh_jid=1141106). I found the various Braintree resources and documentation to be very helpful and I learned a lot about Braintree tech (and picked up a few new web dev tricks along the way).
